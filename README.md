# NumPy Practice

This repository is dedicated to learning through various examples about <b>NumPy</b>, a core library widely used in Python for scientific computing. NumPy is optimized for multi-dimensional array and matrix operations, essential for data-intensive tasks. We'll start with the basics and gradually move to more complex operations.

## 1. Creating NumPy Arrays

NumPy arrays can be created from Python lists or tuples using the `np.array()` function. You can also create arrays filled with zeros or ones using `np.zeros()` and `np.ones()`, or create a range of values using `np.arange()` or `np.linspace()`.

## 2. NumPy Operations

NumPy supports a wide range of mathematical operations. These operations are performed element-wise on arrays, including arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), trigonometric functions, exponential and logarithmic functions, and more. NumPy also supports matrix operations like dot product, matrix multiplication, and transpose.

## 3. Experiencing the Speed of NumPy Operations

NumPy operations are significantly faster than standard Python operations, especially for large arrays. This speed-up is due to NumPy's implementation in C and its ability to perform operations on entire arrays without the need for Python loops.

## 4. Accessing Array Elements, Slicing, and Data Extraction

Elements in a NumPy array can be accessed using square brackets and indices. Slicing is also supported, allowing you to select a subset of an array using a range of indices. Boolean indexing can be used for data extraction based on conditional criteria.

## 5. Manipulating Arrays (Splitting and Merging)

NumPy provides functions to split arrays into smaller arrays (`np.split()`, `np.hsplit()`, `np.vsplit()`) and to merge or concatenate arrays into larger ones (`np.concatenate()`, `np.vstack()`, `np.hstack()`).
